          Wrong Address Disclaimer
        </h2>
        <p>
          Please ensure your address is correct at checkout. Due to strict
          shipping schedules, address changes are not guaranteed. ShapeON is not
          responsible for orders shipped to an address entered incorrectly by
          the buyer. If the order has shipped, we must wait to see if it is
          returned to us; if returned, we can re-ship to a corrected address
          (additional postage may apply) or issue a refund.

          Delivery of Items
        </h2>
        <p>
          If tracking states “Delivered” to your address, ShapeON does not issue
          refunds for non-receipt claims. Please contact the designated carrier
          (e.g., USPS/UPS) for assistance in locating the package.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[var(--clr-darck)] mb-4">Returns</h2>
        <p>
          To obtain a <b>full refund</b> under our
          <b>60-day satisfaction guarantee</b>, you must return all bottles
          included in your order (empty, full, or partially full — including any
          bonus/free bottles) within <b>sixty (60) days</b> of the original
          purchase date. Include a note inside the package with:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Your Order ID (found on your receipt)</li>
          <li>

            received

          <li>The original packing slip (if available)</li>

        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> Failure to return all bottles may result in a partial
          refund.

        <p>
          You are responsible for return shipping. Once our fulfillment center
          receives and verifies your return, a refund will be issued to the
          original method of payment. Depending on your bank, it may take
