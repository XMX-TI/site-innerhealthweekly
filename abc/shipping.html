    <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>

    <h2>Processing Time</h2>
    <p>
      Please allow a processing time of 1-2 business days for your order to be
      shipped. During holidays, there may be delays in processing orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      If invalid information is provided, we cannot process your order due to
      inaccurate or incomplete payment or address details. Your order processing
      may be delayed by an additional 3-5 business days if invalid information
      is provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: All shipping addresses are verified through the US Postal Service.
      If you are unsure about your shipping address, please visit USPS.com. This
      does not apply to international orders.
    </p>
    <p>We ship Monday through Friday, excluding weekends and US holidays.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>EXCLUDING WEEKENDS, HOLIDAYS, OR POSTAL HOLIDAYS.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Delivery Time Within the USA - Standard Shipping:</h2>
    <p>
      Transit time depends on the shipping method selected. Please note that
      transit time does not include weekends or holidays. All delivery times are
      estimates. Presgera is not responsible for delivery delays due to events
      beyond our control, including material shortages, strikes, transportation
      disruptions, or natural disasters.
    </p>

    <h2>Refused, Lost, Stolen, or Delayed Packages</h2>
    <p>
      In the case of a refused package, the shipping and handling fee will be
      charged to the payment method selected at checkout and deducted from any
      refund. For refused products, no refund will be issued until the product
      is received and inspected by the Presgera team.
    </p>
    <p>
      United Parcel Service (UPS) is the primary delivery service. We cannot
      guarantee replacement delivery for lost or stolen packages shipped via
      UPS. For delays or issues with your delivery, please contact
      support@presgera.com. Presgera is not responsible for lost, stolen, or
      delayed packages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: In very rare cases, international shipping to some countries may
      take 4-6 weeks. In severe cases, 8-12 weeks. Presgera is not responsible
      for delays caused by the customs clearance processes of the destination
      country. Shipping to certain countries may require additional shipping
      costs due to geographic location.
    </p>

    <h2>Cancel Order</h2>
    <p>
      Due to high order volume, a customer’s order goes directly to our
      fulfillment center for processing. If the customer contacts us within 24
      hours of purchase, they may cancel their order. If the customer contacts
      us after 24 hours of purchase, they can no longer cancel their order. If
      your order has already been processed or shipped, we cannot cancel the
      order. Customers must either refuse the package and notify us immediately
      at support@presgera.com with the date of refusal or return the package
      with a valid tracking number and provide us with the tracking number for
      verification. Once we receive and inspect the package at our warehouse, we
      can process a refund.
    </p>

    <h2>Incorrect Address Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      It is the buyer’s responsibility to ensure the address is entered
      correctly. Due to strict shipping schedules, we cannot guarantee address
      changes. Please double-check the entered address, as we cannot be held
      responsible for packages sent to the incorrect address provided by the
      buyer. If your order has already been processed or shipped, we cannot
      change the address. The only thing we can do is wait to see if the package
      is returned to us. In that case, we can offer a reshipment or refund.
    </p>

    <h2>Delivery of Items</h2>
    <p>
      If a customer’s tracking number confirms delivery to the customer’s
      address, Presgera does not offer refunds if the item was not delivered. If
      an item is not received despite tracking information confirming delivery,
      please contact the relevant shipping carrier, USPS, for assistance.
    </p>

    <h2>Returns</h2>
    <p>
      To receive a full refund for your bottle(s), you must return all bottles,
      whether empty, full, or partially full (including any "bonus" or
      "complimentary" bottles as part of your order) to our fulfillment center
      at the address below within sixty (60) days of the date you originally
      ordered the product, along with a handwritten or printed note – inside the
      package – clearly stating the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your Order ID (found on your receipt)</li>
      <li>Your full name and full address where the delivery was made</li>
      <li>Your email address and phone number</li>
      <li>Your original packing slip (if available)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: Failure to return all bottles will result in a partial refund.</p>
    <p>
      For your full refund to be processed, the product must arrive at our
      fulfillment center within sixty (60) days of the original purchase date.
      Failure to return all purchased bottles, whether empty, full, or partially
      full (including any "bonus," "complimentary," or "gift" bottles), or
      failure to clearly write your order details as specified above so that a
      fulfillment center employee can clearly read and match your return, will
      result in us being unable to issue a refund. You pay for return shipping.
      Once our fulfillment center receives the package and forwards the correct
      information to us, a refund will be issued. Your refund will be credited
      to your bank account and may take up to 3-5 business days to appear on
      your statement, depending on the processing speed of your bank.
    </p>
    <p>All returns must be shipped via USPS to the following address:</p>
    <p>
      Presgera<br />
      19655 E 35th Dr., Suite 100, Aurora, CO 80011
    </p>
    <p>
      You must provide a tracking number for your return. Failure to provide a
      tracking number may delay the verification of your return.
    </p>
    <p>
      By ordering through our website, you agree to the Terms and Conditions.
